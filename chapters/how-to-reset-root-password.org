* How to reset root passwd

** Boot into single user mode

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  # disk: hd0+ hd1+
  # >> OpenBSD/amd64 BOOT 3.33
  boot> boot -s
#+END_SRC


** Mount the =/= and =/usr= then run =passwd=

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  #
  # Both / and /usr will need to be mounted read-write.
  #
  fsck -p / && mount -uw /
  fsck -p /usr && mount /usr

  #
  # You already have root privileges from being in single user mode,
  # so you will not be prompted to provide the current password.
  #
  passwd
#+END_SRC

After that, you can either pressing =CTRL-D= to resume the normal boot process to multi-user mode or by entering =reboot=.
