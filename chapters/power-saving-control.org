* Power saving control

** Enable =apmd= daemon

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  rcctl enable apmd
  rcctl set apmd flags -A
#+END_SRC

Reboot or restart service by running =rcctl restart apmd=


** Flags description:

=-A=: Start apmd in automatic performance adjustment mode (the default).

=-H=: Start apmd in manual performance adjustment mode, initialising =hw.setperf= to =100=.

=-L=: Start apmd in manual performance adjustment mode, initialising =hw.setperf= to =0=.

=-t seconds=: apmd periodically polls the APM driver for the current power state.  If the battery charge level changes substantially or the external power status changes, the new status is logged.  The polling rate defaults to once per 10 minutes, but may be specified using the =-t= command-line flag.

=-Z percent=: Automatically hibernate the system if no AC is connected and the estimated battery life is equal or below percent.

=-z percent=: Automatically suspend the system if no AC is connected and the estimated battery life is equal or below percent. If both =-Z= and =-z= are specified, the last one will supersede the other.  After a resume, the effect of those options is inhibited for 60 seconds.
