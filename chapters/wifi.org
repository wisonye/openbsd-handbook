* WIFI

** If you're installing =OpenBSD= on =Appple Silicon=

The default NIC should be =bwfm0=, you can confirm by running =dmesg=:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  dmesg | grep bwfm

  # bwfm0 at pci1 dev 0 function 0 "Broadcom BCM4378" rev 0x07: msi
  # bwfm0: address xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
#+END_SRC

=ifconfig= also show the NIC name:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  ifconfg

  # bwfm0: flags=
  #        index
  #        groups: wlan
  #        media: IEEE802.11 autoselect
  #        status: no network
  #        ieeee80211: nwid ""
#+END_SRC


*** Create =/etc/hostname.NIC_NAME= with the following settings

For example, my MacBookAir2 NIC name is =bwfm0=, then create =/etc/hostname.bwfm0=.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  nwid YOUR_SSID_HERE wpakey YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD_HERE
  inet autoconf
#+END_SRC

You have to use =nwid (Network ID)= instead of =join= if you're trying to connect to hidden SSID, as =join= only for connecting to public WIFI!!!


*** Restrat =/etc/netstart= script to take effect

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  sh /etc/netstart
#+END_SRC
